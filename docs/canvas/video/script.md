## Scene 1: Introduction

Welcome to AOMUS! AOMUS, short for 'All-in-One for Melbourne University Students,' is an Android app designed specifically for new students at the University of Melbourne. With AOMUS, you can easily get familiar with the campus, manage your schedule, and explore all the important buildings and interesting locations on campus. For new students, this app will be your best companion, helping you quickly adapt to university life.

## Scene 2: Profile Setup

After downloading and installing the AOMUS app, the first step is to create your profile. This process is very simple and only takes a few steps. First, enter your username, university email, and program of study. This information will help us provide personalized recommendations and help you integrate into campus life.

## Scene 3: Campus Navigation

With your profile set, it’s time to explore the campus. AOMUS provides several predefined routes to help you navigate the beautiful University of Melbourne grounds. Whether you want to find a specific building or simply take a stroll along a classic campus route, AOMUS can guide you. Just select your destination and follow the directions on the map to easily reach your target.

(Additional) Student Voiceover: This route is super convenient, especially for a new student like me who isn't yet familiar with the campus layout. With AOMUS, I don't have to worry about getting lost, which makes me feel much more confident.

## Scene 4: Check-Ins at Places of Interest

While exploring the campus, AOMUS has a fun feature that allows you to check in at key locations. Whenever you arrive at a landmark or place of interest, you can use AOMUS to scan the QR code there. This not only keeps a record of your journey but also lets you leave your own comments to share with other students.

(Additional) Student Voiceover: This place is really beautiful, especially when the sun shines on the building, making it feel so peaceful. I hope there are more check-in spots like this so I can explore the entire campus.

## Scene 5: Using Chatbot for Information

Curious about a particular building? AOMUS provides detailed information about key campus landmarks, powered by ChatGPT. You can learn about the history, location, and purpose of each building. But that's not all! You can ask the chatbot anything about UniMelb—whether it's about campus facilities, upcoming events, or student services. However, be careful, if you try asking it something unrelated—like the meaning of life or where to find the best pizza in town—it'll politely refuse. AOMUS keeps things strictly on campus, with a sense of professional!

##  (Additional) Scene 6: Viewing and Modifying Course Details

In addition to exploring the campus, AOMUS helps you manage your course information. You can view your schedule, check classroom locations, and even update any changes in real-time. Whether it's adjusting class times or updating the classroom location, AOMUS makes sure you stay informed and never miss a class.

(Additional) Student Voiceover: This is so convenient! With this app, I can easily check my schedule and make sure I'm always up to date if there's a change in the classroom. I no longer have to worry about getting lost because of last-minute changes.
