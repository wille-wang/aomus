This repository intends to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/), which was adapted from the [Angular Commit Style](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Commits can only be submitted via [branching](#branching) and [pull requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests#best-practices-for-creating-pull-requests)!

### Branching

- **bugfix branch** (`fix-xxx`): bug fixes
- **documentation branch** (`docs-xxx`): documentation writing

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the type tags following the [commit convention](#committing).
